# Landing page for a fictional Company!

This is a landing page made for the Berkeley Coding Bootcamp it has been coded
from scratch using pure HTML and CSS

I decided to make it for a fictional company that let you turn your cat into a
cyborg from the distant future

Inspired by the cyborg dogs from the book Snowcrash
